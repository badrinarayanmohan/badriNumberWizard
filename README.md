# Number Wizard

Number Wizard is a simple text based Unity game using C# where the computer finds out what the user thinks.
Number Wizard was my first unity game where the user needs to think of a number in his mind and the computer tries to find out the number by guessing if the stated number is higher or lower than what is thought upon. The computer wins if its able to find the number thought by the player. The computer has only a limited number of tries to find the number.
